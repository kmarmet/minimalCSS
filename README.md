# minimalCSS
Very minimal CSS framework for quickly prototyping pages.

    * The top section is a CSS reset
    * To place more than one item into a row without using float or inline-block simply
    add the class "flex" to the parent container
    * You can also use flex-spread, flex-wrap, etc
    * The rest of the framework is simply to quickly add responsive widths to elements
    * DW = Desktop Width
    * LW = Laptop Width
    * TW = Tablet Width
    * MW = Mobile Width
    * If you want a div to be 65% on desktop, 80% on tablet and 100% on mobile you would simple say
    <div class="dw-65 tw-80 mw-100"></div>
